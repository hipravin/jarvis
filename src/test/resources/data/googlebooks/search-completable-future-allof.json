        "description": "Java developers usually tackle the complexity of software development through object-oriented programming (OOP). But not every problem is a good match for OOP. The functional programming (FP) paradigm offers you another approach to solving problems, and Java provides easy-to-grasp FP tools such as lambda expressions and Streams. If you're interested in applying FP concepts to your Java code, this book is for you. Author Ben Weidig highlights different aspects of functional programming and shows you how to incorporate them into your code without going \"fully functional.\" You'll learn how, when, and why to use FP concepts such as immutability and pure functions to write more concise, reasonable, and future-proof code. Many developers seek to expand their horizons by using OOP and FP together. It's no longer either-or; it's both. In this book, you will: Get a high-level overview of functional programming, including the types already available to Java developers Explore different FP concepts and learn how to use them Learn how to augment your code and use Java's new functional features in your daily work without going fully functional Develop a functional mindset and improve your programming skills regardless of language or paradigm",

Many old Java idioms are no longer needed, and new features and programming paradigms can make you far more effective. However, navigating these changes can be challenging. Core Java for the Impatient, Third Edition, is a complete yet concise guide that reflects all changes through Java SE 17, Oracle's latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release. Written by Cay S. Horstmann--author of the classic two-volume Core Java--this indispensable tutorial offers a faster, easier pathway for learning modern Java. Horstmann covers everything working developers need to know, including the powerful concepts of lambda expressions and streams, modern constructs such as records and sealed classes, and sophisticated concurrent programming techniques. Given the size and scope of Java 17, there's plenty to cover, but it's presented in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding, with plenty of practical insights and sample code to help you quickly apply all that's new. Test code as you create it with JShell Improve your object-oriented design with records and sealed classes Effectively use text blocks, switch expressions, and pattern matching Understand functional programming with lambda expressions Streamline and optimize data management with the Streams API Use modern library features and threadsafe data structures to implement concurrency reliably Work with the modularized Java API and third-party modules Take advantage of API improvements for working with collections, input/output, regular expressions, and processes Learn the APIs for date/time processing and internationalization Whether you're an experienced developer just getting started with modern Java, or have been programming with Java for years, this guide will help you write more robust, efficient, and secure Java code.

Construct real-world examples related to machine learning, data mining, image processing, and client/server environments Who This Book Is For If you are a competent Java developer with a good understanding of concurrency but have no knowledge of how to effectively implement concurrent programs or use streams to make processes more efficient, then this book is for you. What You Will Learn Design concurrent applications by converting a sequential algorithm into a concurrent one Discover how to avoid all the possible problems you can get in concurrent algorithms Use the Executor framework to manage concurrent tasks without creating threads Extend and modify Executors to adapt their behavior to your needs Solve problems using the divide and conquer technique and the Fork/Join framework Process massive data sets with parallel streams and Map/Reduce implementation Control data-race conditions using concurrent data structures and synchronization mechanisms Test and monitor concurrent applications In Detail Concurrency programming allows several large tasks to be divided into smaller sub-tasks, which are further processed as individual tasks that run in parallel. All the sub-tasks are combined together once the required results are achieved; they are then merged to get the final output. The whole process is very complex. This process goes from the design of concurrent algorithms to the testing phase where concurrent applications need extra attention. Java includes a comprehensive API with a lot of ready-to-use components to implement powerful concurrency applications in an easy way, but with a high flexibility to adapt these components to your needs. The book starts with a full description of design principles of concurrent applications and how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. We'll show you how to use all the components of the Java Concurrency API from basics to the most advanced techniques to implement them in powerful concurrency applications in Java. You will be using real-world examples of complex algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, image processing in client / server environments. Next, you will learn how to use the most important components of the Java 8 Concurrency API: the Executor framework to execute multiple tasks in your applications, the phaser class to implement concurrent tasks divided into phases, and the Fork/Join framework to implement concurrent tasks that can be split into smaller problems (using the divide and conquer technique). Toward the end, we will cover the new inclusions in Java 8 API, the Map and Reduce model, and the Map and Collect model. The book will also teach you about the data structures and synchronization utilities to avoid data-race conditions and other critical problems. Finally, the book ends with a detailed description of the tools and techniques that you can use to test a Java concurrent application. Style and approach A complete guide implementing real-world examples with algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing in client/server environments. All the examples are explained in a step-by-step approach.",

        "description": "This Book will surely change your approach to Java Functional programming .This is one of the simplest Book for Java Functional Programming on the planet. Before scripting any feature , I used to ask 4 questions to myself-What is this feature all about ? Why am I going for it ? Where can I use it in realtime ? And finally How can I implement it ? I have tried to simplify the concept of Streams and Lambda with help of sketch/images in-order to make it self explanatory. In This Book I have covered industry trending concepts like Streams,Lambda,Method Reference, Functional Interfaces and other most commonly used Java features from Java 8 to Java 20. This book is an insightful and practical guide that takes readers on a journey into the world of functional programming, exploring key concepts such as functional programming paradigms, streams, lambda expressions, and method references. This book is an essential resource for both beginners and experienced programmers looking to unlock the full potential of functional programming in their software development projects. The book begins by demystifying functional programming, providing a clear understanding of its principles and benefits. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Why This Book Stands Out: Drawing on over a decade of core software development experience, the author provides an insightful and practical guide that simplifies complex concepts using sketches and images. This book is not just for reading but for understanding and implementing functional programming in real-world scenarios. Key Concepts Covered: Functional Programming Paradigms: Gain a clear understanding of the principles and benefits of functional programming, including pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.

        "description": "Reduce development time by organizing your programs as chains of functional interfaces and see that the advantages of using functional interfaces include the flexibility and power of inlined functional chains and reuse of functional methods utilized throughout the Java API. You’ll see how complex logical expressions can be reduced to chains of predicates and how chains of comparators can be used to sort data by several criteria in order. Other examples include streams that utilize functional interfaces to filter, sort, transform, and perform calculations on data; CompletableFutures that use functional interfaces to create cascading and parallel execution threads; and JavaFX programs that use functional interfaces to monitor the data backed by their graphical components. Each chapter contains a complete programming project: the Discount Dave project shows you how to qualify car customers by organizing questions as a list of predicates; the Real Estate Broker project shows you how to use chains of comparators to filter and sort homes according to customer priorities; the Dave's Part Inventory project shows you how to query and write reports from an inventory database using stream operations; and the Sentence Builder project shows you how to correct a sentence by implementing each grammar rule as a separate link in a future chain. Functional Interfaces in Java will help you quickly develop powerful and reliable programs that utilize functional interfaces to implement logic and calculations. What You Will LearnUse the functional interfaces in the java.util.function package to perform conditional logic, transform and generate data, and perform calculations Filter and sort data by several criteria using comparators Process collections and filter, sort, transform, and reduce stream elements with functional interfaces Write cascading and parallel execution threads Who This Book Is For Computer science student or a professional Java programmer. This work is a rigorous discussion of the application of functional interfaces, so prerequisites for this text include basic Java programming and object-oriented Java programming.",

        "description": "This book is a collection of developer code recipes and best practices for persisting data using Spring, particularly Spring Boot. The book is structured around practical recipes, where each recipe discusses a performance case or performance-related case, and almost every recipe has one or more applications. Mainly, when we try to accomplish something (e.g., read some data from the database), there are several approaches to do it, and, in order to choose the best way, you have to know the implied trades-off from a performance perspective. You’ll see that in the end, all these penalties slow down the application. Besides presenting the arguments that favor a certain choice, the application is written in Spring Boot style which is quite different than plain Hibernate. Persistence is an important set of techniques and technologies for accessing and using data, and this book demonstrates that data is mobile regardless of specific applications and contexts. In Java development, persistence is a key factor in enterprise, ecommerce, cloud and other transaction-oriented applications. After reading and using this book, you'll have the fundamentals to apply these persistence solutions into your own mission-critical enterprise Java applications that you build using Spring. What You Will Learn Shape *-to-many associations for best performancesEffectively exploit Spring Projections (DTO) Learn best practices for batching inserts, updates and deletes Effectively fetch parent and association in a single SELECTLearn how to inspect Persistent Context contentDissect pagination techniques (offset and keyset)Handle queries, locking, schemas, Hibernate types, and more Who This Book Is For Any Spring and Spring Boot developer that wants to squeeze the persistence layer performances.",

        "description": "Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years. The addition of lambda expressions (closures) and streams represents the biggest change to Java programming since the introduction of generics and annotations. Now, with Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient , internationally renowned Java author Cay S. Horstmann concisely introduces Java 8’s most valuable new features (plus a few Java 7 innovations that haven’t gotten the attention they deserve). If you’re an experienced Java programmer, Horstmann’s practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of these and other Java language and platform improvements. This indispensable guide includes Coverage of using lambda expressions (closures) to write computation “snippets” that can be passed to utility functions The brand-new streams API that makes Java collections far more flexible and efficient Major updates to concurrent programming that make use of lambda expressions (filter/map/reduce) and that provide dramatic performance improvements for shared counters and hash tables A full chapter with advice on how you can put lambda expressions to work in your own programs Coverage of the long-awaited introduction of a well-designed date/time/calendar library (JSR 310) A concise introduction to JavaFX, which is positioned to replace Swing GUIs, and to the Nashorn Javascript engine A thorough discussion of many small library changes that make Java programming more productive and enjoyable This is the first title to cover all of these highly anticipated improvements and is invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow’s most robust, efficient, and secure Java code.",

Next, we cover object oriented code: functions, lambdas, and properties – all while using Kotlin's new features. Then, we move on to null safety aspects and type parameterization. We show you how to destructure expressions and even write your own. We also take you through important topics like testing, concurrency, microservices, and a whole lot more. By the end of this book you will be able to compose different services and build your own applications. Style and approach An easy to follow guide that covers the full set of features in Kotlin programming.",

You'll learn how to use jOOQ in Spring Boot apps as a replacement for SpringTemplate and Spring Data JPA. Next, you'll unleash jOOQ type-safe queries and CRUD operations via jOOQ's records, converters, bindings, types, mappers, multi-tenancy, logging, and testing. Later, the book shows you how to use jOOQ to exploit powerful SQL features such as UDTs, embeddable types, embedded keys, and more. As you progress, you'll cover trending topics such as identifiers, batching, lazy loading, pagination, and HTTP long conversations. For implementation purposes, the jOOQ examples explained in this book are written in the Spring Boot context for Maven/Gradle against MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, and Oracle. By the end of this book, you'll be a jOOQ power user capable of integrating jOOQ in the most modern and sophisticated apps including enterprise apps, microservices, and so on. What you will learn • Enable the jOOQ Code Generator in any combination of Java and Kotlin, Maven and Gradle • Generate jOOQ artifacts directly from database schema, or without touching the real database • Use jOOQ DSL to write and execute a wide range of queries for different databases • Understand jOOQ type-safe queries, CRUD operations, converters, bindings, and mappers • Implement advanced SQL concepts such as stored procedures, derived tables, CTEs, window functions, and database views • Implement jOOQ multi-tenancy, tuning, jOOQ SPI, logging, and testing Who this book is for This book is for Java developers who write applications that interact with databases via SQL. No prior experience with jOOQ is assumed.",

        "description": "Master the principles to make applications robust, scalable and responsive About This Book Implement concurrent applications using the Java 9 Concurrency API and its new components Improve the performance of your applications and process more data at the same time, taking advantage of all of your resources Construct real-world examples related to machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, and more Who This Book Is For This book is for competent Java developers who have basic understanding of concurrency, but knowledge of effective implementation of concurrent programs or usage of streams for making processes more efficient is not required What You Will Learn Master the principles that every concurrent application must follow See how to parallelize a sequential algorithm to obtain better performance without data inconsistencies and deadlocks Get the most from the Java Concurrency API components Separate the thread management from the rest of the application with the Executor component Execute phased-based tasks in an efficient way with the Phaser components Solve problems using a parallelized version of the divide and conquer paradigm with the Fork / Join framework Find out how to use parallel Streams and Reactive Streams Implement the “map and reduce” and “map and collect” programming models Control the concurrent data structures and synchronization mechanisms provided by the Java Concurrency API Implement efficient solutions for some actual problems such as data mining, machine learning, and more In Detail Concurrency programming allows several large tasks to be divided into smaller sub-tasks, which are further processed as individual tasks that run in parallel. Java 9 includes a comprehensive API with lots of ready-to-use components for easily implementing powerful concurrency applications, but with high flexibility so you can adapt these components to your needs. The book starts with a full description of the design principles of concurrent applications and explains how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. You will then be introduced to Threads and Runnables, which are an integral part of Java 9's concurrency API. You will see how to use all the components of the Java concurrency API, from the basics to the most advanced techniques, and will implement them in powerful real-world concurrency applications. The book ends with a detailed description of the tools and techniques you can use to test a concurrent Java application, along with a brief insight into other concurrency mechanisms in JVM. Style and approach This is a complete guide that implements real-world examples of algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing in client/server environments. All the examples are explained using a step-by-step approach.",

With this practical book, Java developers will first learn how to view problems in the reactive way, and then build programs that leverage the best features of this exciting new programming paradigm. Authors Tomasz Nurkiewicz and Ben Christensen include concrete examples that use the RxJava library to solve real-world performance issues on Android devices as well as the server. You’ll learn how RxJava leverages parallelism and concurrency to help you solve today’s problems. This book also provides a preview of the upcoming 2.0 release. Write programs that react to multiple asynchronous sources of input without descending into \"callback hell\" Get to that aha! moment when you understand how to solve problems in the reactive way Cope with Observables that produce data too quickly to be consumed Explore strategies to debug and to test programs written in the reactive style Efficiently exploit parallelism and concurrency in your programs Learn about the transition to RxJava version 2",

        "description": "A Patterns Approach to Designing Distributed Systems and Solving Common Implementation Problems More and more enterprises today are dependent on cloud services from providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP. They also use products, such as Kafka and Kubernetes, or databases, such as YugabyteDB, Cassandra, MongoDB, and Neo4j, that are distributed by nature. Because these distributed systems are inherently stateful systems, enterprise architects and developers need to be prepared for all the things that can and will go wrong when data is stored on multiple servers--from process crashes to network delays and unsynchronized clocks. Patterns of Distributed Systems describes a set of patterns that have been observed in mainstream open-source distributed systems. Studying the common problems and the solutions that are embodied by the patterns in this guide will give you a better understanding of how these systems work, as well as a solid foundation in distributed system design principles. Featuring real-world code examples from systems like Kafka and Kubernetes, these patterns and solutions will prepare you to confidently traverse open-source codebases and understand implementations you encounter \"in the wild.\" Review the building blocks of consensus algorithms, like Paxos and Raft, for ensuring replica consistency in distributed systems Understand the use of logical timestamps in databases, a fundamental concept for data versioning Explore commonly used partitioning schemes, with an in-depth look at intricacies of two-phase-commit protocol Analyze mechanisms used in implementing cluster coordination tasks, such as group membership, failure detection, and enabling robust cluster coordination Learn techniques for establishing effective network communication between cluster nodes. Along with enterprise architects and data architects, software developers working with cloud services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EKS, and Azure CosmosDB or GCP Cloud Spanner will find this set of patterns to be indispensable.

        "description": "Graph Databases in Action introduces you to graph database concepts by comparing them with relational database constructs. You'll learn just enough theory to get started, then progress to hands-on development. Discover use cases involving social networking, recommendation engines, and personalization. Summary Relationships in data often look far more like a web than an orderly set of rows and columns. Graph databases shine when it comes to revealing valuable insights within complex, interconnected data such as demographics, financial records, or computer networks. In Graph Databases in Action, experts Dave Bechberger and Josh Perryman illuminate the design and implementation of graph databases in real-world applications. You'll learn how to choose the right database solutions for your tasks, and how to use your new knowledge to build agile, flexible, and high-performing graph-powered applications! Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology Isolated data is a thing of the past! Now, data is connected, and graph databases—like Amazon Neptune, Microsoft Cosmos DB, and Neo4j—are the essential tools of this new reality. Graph databases represent relationships naturally, speeding the discovery of insights and driving business value. About the book Graph Databases in Action introduces you to graph database concepts by comparing them with relational database constructs. You'll learn just enough theory to get started, then progress to hands-on development. Discover use cases involving social networking, recommendation engines, and personalization.
